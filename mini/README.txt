This directory contains some small smten applications:

bmc:: A bounded model checker.
strsolver:: A string constraint solver.

To build the apps, run

  $ make

This will also run the applications.
The bounded model checker runs a test case from the paper it is based on and
prints the result.
The string constraint solver runs a test case from the Smten paper it is based
on and prints the result.
