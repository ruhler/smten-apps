perf9.smten.sk derived from listReverse.sk, a DATA test.

It very quickly gets a stack overflow.

Increasing the stack size: it blows up.

Let's try shrinking the problem, both in terms of 'N' and the unroll amount.

That doesn't help any. Which suggests it could be an infinite blowup.

Let me manually inline some things, try to simplify the test case.

Note: the sketch doesn't matter.
We spend all the time trying to execute the spec.

The problem is in finding a counter-example.

Even just populating and serializing causes problems.
Could this be the same problem we had with perf7.txt, but which that special
case fix misses?

Note: if the input 'n' is concrete, there is no problem.
It has something to do with not knowing the value of 'n'.

Profiling of the gallery doesn't show any useful information.
Perhaps the important SCCs are missing.

Is it in populate or serialize that we get stuck?

We get stuck in populate. In evaluating the resulting list.

Here's a funny thing: we pass an argument 'elems' to the populate function,
but that argument is unused.

If we remove that argument, we no longer blow up. Why?

Very strange.
