Blowup in gallery/lss.sk.

Profiling says it's in a post increment operator, and the time is spent
looking up a variable in a map.

This is strange, because we expect it to be a constant operation.

Let me start by minimizing the test case.

Here's the problem:
   sum = {| (sum | psum) - psum |}

If we replace this line with:
   bit x = ??;
   if (x) {
     sum = sum - psum;
   } else {
     sum = psum - psum;
   }

Then it works fine.

This is consistent with the profiling question: because we are dealing with a
variable lookup whose name is not entirely known.

Except, it isn't to do with post increment?

PRIM_CHAR_LE.

You know what this suggests?
We should finally change the implementation of symbolic chars in Smten to be
like symbolic ints. Because I bet a whole bunch of the options it thinks it
has are identical.

Hmm... You know what may be happening?

insertVar checks if a variable belongs to the local scope to determine whether
to insert locally or globally. Perhaps the name is partially concrete, so it
has to do both, and it's not totally clear which map the insert is made in?

Or perhaps it's just difficult to lookup a partially concrete name in a map?
We would like it to return the combination of both values.
But... maybe it gets stuck looking up the name?

Oh. There was also a bug in PostIncrE.
Did that help any?

It didn't, but I want to check in the fix anyway.
