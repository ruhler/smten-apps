* assert array index in bound (miniTest13.sk)
  - To do this we want to have array length information in deHoleExpr at the
    array access
* support bit[3*4] as a type (miniTest3.sk)
    - array widths are allowed to be generic expressions
      When do we evaluate this?

* support || operator (miniTest31.sk)
* {|} hole generator (miniTest23.sk)
* cast bit to int (miniTest15.sk)
* support 'repeat' keyword (miniTest14.sk)
* support for specified width holes (miniTest10.sk)
* support for assert statements (miniTest10.sk)
* support generators (miniTest5.sk)
* support + operator (miniTest6.sk)
* support - operator (miniTest12.sk)
* support < operator (miniTest18.sk)
* support static global variables (miniTest6.sk)

* support for loops (miniTest8.sk)
* make the pretty printer print prettier
* reuse BlockS for handling function bodies? 
* clean up type inference (leverage an smt solver?)

Document Behaviors of sketch:
* What happens to: ??[4] in terms of type inference?
    blows up
* what happens to: 7[2] in terms of type inference?
    blows up
