Trying to understand the problem with the gallery/log2.sk benchmark.
It's not really a performance problem, but a correctness issue.

My implementation says it is unsatisfiable for input 0.
Sketch says it is satisfiable, using holes:
  repeat 6:
    0xFFFF0000, 16, 16
    0x00007FFF, 1, 0
    0x0000FF80, 8, 8
    0x000000F8, 4, 4
    0x0000000E, 2, 2
    0x00000003, 0, 1

The first problem is: 
  castInt. My implementation doesn't recognize the repeat argument as being
static, so it doesn't repeat it enough.

Let me work around this for now manually.

I want to represent 32 as a bit vector.

How about: 1 << 4?

Or, don't use a repeat loop.
That's probably easiest.

Wow. With that, my sketch works, and it looks much more efficient than the
original sketch.

Cool. Let me make this change then, with a note.
