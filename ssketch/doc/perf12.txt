Another attempt at minimizing isolateRightmost from the gallery.

First step: shrink it, see if that helps.

It blows up, even with W = 2, looking for a candidate program.

Well, this is easy:

There are two problems:
1. isolate0 does not return, for x = 0.
What does this mean in sketch?

Fix: return 0 for x = 0.

2. The generator does not return, for all 0 holes.
Fix: return 0 for the default case.

With these two fixes, the problem disappears.

What is supposed to be the behavior of a function if you don't return
anything? Default to pad?

What do I do now?

Is there some way I can test this?

Let me do the following:
1. Read the sketch manual, see if it says anything
  Nothing. But it has an example of a generator which doesn't always return.
2. Read my implementation, see what it does 
   If you apply a function which doesn't return anything.
  It uses VoidV. (See the 'returned' function)
  But note, this may be the wrong type.
  It might be nice to use a pad, but we don't have the return type?
  Actually, we do. So we should be able to use pad instead if we want.
3. Write the following test cases:
 * A non-returning spec of type bit[W]
   A sketch which returns ??
  Sketch says the spec doesn't return. Perhaps I need to trick it.
  With trick:
    It gives a bad answer?

It says:
  return 0;

I want something equal to:
  if (in == 0) {
     return 1;
  }

Surely that's wrong?

There are some issues.

Anyway, I have an example here where it returns '0'.
Let me see if I can change that.

No.

So it looks like no return means zero.
Let me assume no return means pad.

Let me use the type information I have to have the same behavior, see if that
fixes the problem.
