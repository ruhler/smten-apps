Understand memory blowup in gallery/signedAvg.sk

Status:
  Stack overflow searching for a candidate.

The generate stack is huge.

First step: minimize.

I shrunk it a bit.

Profiling says: It's all just ite stuff. Nothing useful.

Perhaps I need to add more SCCs.

This is interesting: I changed div2 to just return its argument.
But there seems to be a big difference between 
  div2(y ^ x) and just (y ^ x).

Why would that be the case?

It's odd.

* return {| x | y | div2(y ^ x) |} is fine.
* Using if expressions for each of them is fine.

But mixing {|x | y |} with an if expression for div2 blows up. Why?
