* Clean up reference directory?

* Clarify whether I support format 1.9 or not
  Currently:
    - input format is pre 1.9
    - output format is 1.9

* classify more test cases

Performance::
* Use 0-indexed vectors instead of 1-indexed?
    Maybe just have a dummy value 0 which is never used?
* Switch to alternate formation of k-induction
    Specifically: one which can skip bounds to make harder queries and
    less concrete evaluation?
