Priority::
1. Write some unit tests for model checking in the old FORMAT
   that I understand. Simple is good.
2. Clean up reference directory to have just:
    -  abc
    - old aiger
    - and maybe picosat
3. Write a wrapper around abc to run model checking
    read_aiger, bmc?, write_aiger
4. Write a util which checks if a given witness for a model checking problem
    is valid: probably by calling aigsim
5. Update my model checker to use old FORMAT
6. Set up a test framework:
   Organize tests by UNSAT and SAT, using abc to check UNSAT.
   Verify my model checker reports UNSAT for all in UNSAT.
   Verify counter-examples for all in SAT.
